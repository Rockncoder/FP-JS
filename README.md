FizzBuzz in JavaScript aka Functional Programming in JavaScript

The code to go with my SoCal Code Camp talk 14 November 2015.
Massively updated for Silicon Valley Code Camp, 1 October 2016.
Updated again for SoCal Code Camp at USC in Los Angeles, 2+3 December 2017
A PDF of the slides from the talk are in the root directory: FizzBuzzJavaScript.pdf.
Once we are past fizzbuzz3 we are mutation free.

Many of the ideas are from the book, 
  "The Magical World of Functional Programming: Part 1: Thinking Functionally" 
  by K Anand Kumar

  It is a two part book series, but I only pulled ideas from the first.

Another great book, but a more challenging read is: 
  Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
